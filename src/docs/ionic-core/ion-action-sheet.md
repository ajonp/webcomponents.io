# ion-action-sheet

<a href="https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic/tree/core/packages/core/src/components/action-sheet" target="_blank">Github</a>

```html
<ion-action-sheet></ion-action-sheet>
```

In all reality this component is never really used by the developer. You actually add 
<stencil-route-link url="/components/ion-action-sheet-controller">action-sheet-controller</stencil-route-link>

Which allows the remainder of the functionality to occur.
