# Webcomponents.io

The goal is to have well documented webcomponents. Why not just use <https://www.webcomponents.org/> ? Please do that too!
My overall goal is to start with cataloging Ionic Core components and how to use them. Then move past that for what is next.

# The goal
A single place to find all things webcomponents.
